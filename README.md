# Encoding-and-Language-Detector

Handy online tool to detect the encoding and language of text files. This online tool makes use of ["detect-file-encoding-and-language"](https://www.npmjs.com/package/detect-file-encoding-and-language) which I've created for my Chrome Extension "Movie Subtitles" which is still being developed at the moment.
